### Summary

The Link Script syntax highlighter For VSCode. It's not perfect yet but it gets the job done. If you are new to the Link Script language, refer to the [tree](https://github.com/link-script/tree) repo, or the [base](https://github.com/link-script/base) and explore around the source code. It's far from complete but a labor of love. Making a little progress all the time.

### Mount

The xo-code extension is being developed by the folks at [Mount](https://mount.build), a California-based project for helping humanity master information and computation. Mount started off in the winter of 2008 as a spark of an idea, to forming a company 10 years later in the winter of 2018, to a seed of a project just beginning its development phases. Mount funds xo-code's development. It is entirely bootstrapped by working full time and running [Etsy](https://etsy.com/shop/link-script) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AMount+Build) shops. Also find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/link-script), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/link-script), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/link-script).
